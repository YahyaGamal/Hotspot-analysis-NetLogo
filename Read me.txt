The model generates patches with a random state variable. 

The patches can be clustered at initialisation based on the clustering-degree parameter:

- 0 --> no clustering
- 4 --> highest degree of clustering

The patches can be coloured based on:

- state
	- green represents higher values
- hotspot
	- red: high/high
	- blue: low/low
	- white: insignificant
- local Moran's I
	- red represents higher values

The hotspot calculations are based on: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-hot-spot-analysis-getis-ord-gi-spatial-stati.htm
